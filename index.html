   <H1>Hi</H1>
   <P>This is a very simple site made to store 'hello world' examples and perhaps some explanations of how they work. I'm still deciding on how i want to structure the page/site so don't expect it to stay the same; much less, work correctly!</P>
      <li>Have a <a href="pgs/index.html">look</a> if you'd like.</li>
